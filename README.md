# VBA-Common-Library
A library of common excel VBA functions that I have found useful over the years.

## How to Use
1. Create a module in excel called `common`. 
2. Copy the functions you need into the `common` module.

## Base64Encode
Encodes string to Base64.

**Input**: `String`

**Output**: `String` encoded to base64
